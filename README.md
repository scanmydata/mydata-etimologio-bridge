# e-Timologio PHP API

A lightweight PHP API for automating the [ΑΑΔΕ e-timologio](https://mydata.aade.gr/timologio) invoicing platform — the Greek tax authority's official invoicing system for myDATA.

This is believed to be the first open-source PHP implementation of the e-timologio API.

> **⚠️ Proof of Concept** — This project works but is not a polished production library. It was built by reverse-engineering the e-timologio jQuery AJAX calls. Anyone is free to use, fork, and improve it.

---

## What it does

- **Issues invoices** to ΑΑΔΕ (myDATA) and retrieves a MARK number
- **Creates draft invoices** for safe testing before going live
- **Auto-creates customers** from Taxisnet data (Greek clients)
- **Auto-populates** customer name, address, city, zip from Taxisnet or e-timologio database
- **Fetches invoice PDFs** by MARK number
- **Supports all common invoice types**: ΑΠΥ, ΑΛΠ, Τιμολόγιο, non-EU (0% VAT)
- **Supports withholding tax** (παρακρατούμενος φόρος)
- **Works as a REST API** — accepts both GET and POST parameters
- Returns clean JSON responses

> **Note on invoice series:** This implementation assumes **Series A** (`'series' => 'A'`) for all invoices. If your e-timologio setup uses a different series, update the `series` field in `createInvoice()` accordingly.

## Supported Invoice Types

| Code | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `20` | 2.1 | Τιμολόγιο Παροχής Υπηρεσιών (B2B, GR) |
| `21` | 2.2 | Τιμολόγιο Παροχής / Ενδοκοινοτική (B2B, EU) |
| `22` | 2.3 | Τιμολόγιο Παροχής - Τρίτες Χώρες (0% VAT) |
| `57` | 11.1 | ΑΛΠ (Απόδειξη Λιανικής Πώλησης) |
| `58` | 11.2 | ΑΠΥ (Απόδειξη Παροχής Υπηρεσιών) |

## New: `app.php` — fast multi-tenant UI

`app.php` is a self-contained, no-build web UI (vanilla HTML/JS) that sits on top
of `etimologio.php`. Open it in a browser and you get:

- **Multi-account switcher** — many e-timologio accounts (credentials), each with
  many customers. Pick the active company from the header; everything (data,
  sessions, local ledgers) is scoped to it.
- **Στατιστικά** — live dashboard (τρέχων μήνας / προηγούμενος / έτος) with totals
  and a per-type breakdown, parsed from e-timologio's Dashboard.
- **Πελάτες** — smart search (ΑΦΜ / επωνυμία / κωδικός) with one-click drill-down.
- **Καρτέλα πελάτη (ledger)** — combines issued invoices (from e-timologio) with
  **local payments** into a running balance. e-timologio itself stores neither
  payments nor balances, so payments are kept locally (SQLite) and never sent to
  AADE.
- **Είδη** — product/service catalogue with instant filter, **create/edit/delete**
  (with categories, VAT category, unit); feeds the issue form.
- **Έκδοση** — invoice form with ΑΦΜ auto-fill (Taxisnet), draft or live issuance.
- **Ακύρωση** — cancel an issued document by issuing a **correlated credit note**
  (you only need the original MARK). 5.1 is chosen for invoices, 11.4 for retail.
- **Customer create/edit** — with-ΑΦΜ (Taxisnet auto-fill) or personal (no ΑΦΜ).
- **Command palette** (`Ctrl+K`) — jump to any customer's καρτέλα instantly.
- **Δελτίο** — issue a delivery / return note (δελτίο αποστολής / επιστροφής) with
  move purpose, vehicle, dispatch time and delivery address.
- **Instant load** — customers/products render from a local encrypted snapshot
  immediately, then sync with AADE in the background and refresh only if changed.
- **Encrypted local data** — payments, ledgers AND the cache are stored encrypted
  at rest (libsodium).
- **PDF καρτέλας** — export a customer's ledger (debits/credits/running balance) to
  PDF (Greek-correct, via jsPDF).
- **Invoice PDFs** — download single, in bulk by date range, or per customer as a ZIP.
- **Multi-line invoices** — add multiple item lines (product, quantity, unit price) with
  a live net total; each line gets its own VAT rate and classifications.
- **Per-line discounts** — each line accepts a discount (percentage or absolute €).
- **Multi-line delivery notes** — the Δελτίο view uses the same multi-line editor.
- **Category-level classifications** — set default income classifications per product
  category and invoice type (myDATA §9), edited from the Είδη view.
- **Verbal invoice types** — statistics, the customer card and the ledger PDF show the
  full document-type label (e.g. `2.1 - Τιμολόγιο Παροχής Υπηρεσιών`), not just the code.
- **Customer autocomplete on issue** — click the ΑΦΜ/επωνυμία field to search all
  customers; picking one fills every field. Or press **🧾 Έκδοση** on a customer row.
- **Types limited to active series** — the issue type list only offers document types
  that have an open series (series is mandatory to issue).
- **Inline product picker** — pick an item (or create one on the spot); each line shows
  the item's description and VAT %.
- **Per-line discounts & multi-line delivery notes** (see below).

> Requires the PHP `zip` extension for ZIP downloads.

### Multi-client login (auth.php)
The app is multi-tenant **with logins**. A **master admin** manages businesses,
approves public signups, and links each business's AADE (e-timologio) credentials —
which are stored **encrypted in the local DB**, not in `config.php`. Each business logs
in and owns one or more AADE accounts (switchable from the top bar).

Setup: set `MASTER_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `MASTER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `config.php`; on first run
they are hashed into the DB (then you can remove the password). Any legacy `$ACCOUNTS`
entries are auto-migrated to the master admin so existing setups keep working. Password
reset works via the admin panel (token/link) and, if `SMTP_FROM` is configured, by email.

| Auth action (POST `?auth=…`) | Who | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| `login` / `logout` / `me` | public / session | Session login, logout, current user + accounts |
| `signup` | public | Register a business (pending admin approval) |
| `forgot` / `reset` | public | Request a reset token / set a new password |
| `change_password` | session | Change own password |
| `admin_users` / `admin_create_user` / `admin_approve` / `admin_set_status` / `admin_reset_pw` | master | Manage users, approve signups, issue reset links |
| `admin_add_account` / `admin_update_account` / `admin_delete_account` / `admin_user_accounts` | master | Link/unlink a business's encrypted AADE credentials |

> Local payments are stored in an SQLite file (`.localdata.sqlite`), multi-tenant
> (rows scoped by account VAT). Sensitive fields (names, notes, amounts) are
> **encrypted at rest** via `crypto.php` (libsodium); the key lives in `config.php`
> (`ENCRYPTION_KEY`) or an auto-generated `.enckey` file. See `ENDPOINTS.md` for the
> full reverse-engineered endpoint map.

### Local development (PHP on Windows)
For contributing, a portable PHP works fine: enable `curl`, `openssl`, `mbstring`,
`pdo_sqlite`, `sqlite3`, `sodium` in `php.ini`, point `curl.cainfo`/`openssl.cafile`
at a `cacert.pem` (required for AADE HTTPS), then run `php -S 127.0.0.1:8080` from the
repo and open `app.php`. Use `php -l <file>` to lint before committing.

---

## Setup

### Requirements
- PHP 8.0+
- `curl` extension enabled
- `pdo_sqlite` extension enabled (for local payments/ledgers)
- Web server (Apache/Nginx) or Synology Web Station

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pixieapps/mydata-etimologio-bridge.git
cd mydata-etimologio-bridge
cp config.example.php config.php
```

Edit `config.php` and fill in your credentials:

```php
const COMPANY_VAT      = '123456789';         // Your company ΑΦΜ
const USERNAME         = 'your_username';      // e-timologio username
const SUBSCRIPTION_KEY = 'your_key_here';      // Found in Ρυθμίσεις → Στοιχεία Χρήστη
```

Your subscription key is found in e-timologio under **Ρυθμίσεις → Στοιχεία Χρήστη**.

## How it works

e-timologio is an ASP.NET server-rendered application with jQuery AJAX. This library:

1. Logs in via form POST, maintains a session cookie
2. Fetches product/classification data per invoice type from `/Product/GetProduct`
3. Auto-populates customer data from Taxisnet (`/Customer/GetCustomerByTaxis`) for Greek clients, or from the e-timologio customer database (`/Customer/GetProposedCustomersByName`) for foreign clients
4. Submits invoices to `/Invoice/create` (live) or `/TempInvoice/savetempinvoice` (draft)
5. Retrieves PDFs from `/Invoice/PrintInvoice2PdfNew`

The field names and payload structure were reverse-engineered by intercepting jQuery AJAX calls in the browser.

## Security Notes

- Keep `config.php` out of version control (it is in `.gitignore`)
- This API is designed for **private intranet use** — do not expose it to the public internet without adding authentication
- The cookie file (`/tmp/etimologio_cookies.txt`) contains your session — ensure it is not web-accessible

## Status

This is a **proof of concept**. It works, but it is not a polished library. Contributions, improvements, and forks are very welcome. Some areas that could use work:

- Support for more invoice types (11.1 ΑΛΠ verified, others assumed)
- Multi-line invoice support
- Proper error handling and retry logic
- Unit tests
- Refactor into a proper PHP class/library
- Laravel/Symfony package

If you build on this, please share your work with the Greek developer community.
